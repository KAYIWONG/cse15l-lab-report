This lab report aims to document the steps taken to complete a task in a programming competition. 
The task involves accessing the DocSeachSever.java file and performing specific actions using the keywords start and base. 
The report will provide screenshots of each step, as well as keys and hints to help guide the reader through the process.

Step 1: Accessing the DocSeachSever.java File
To begin the task, the first step is to access the DocSeachSever.java file. 
I would using the command: vim<space> D<tag><enter>. 
This file was downloaded from the Lab GitHub page. The screenshot below shows the file being accessed using the vim command:

Once the file is accessed,I will proceed to the next step of the task, which involves using the keywords start and base.
The screenshot below is the example using the start command:
Hint: It is very helpful to familiarizenwith the vim command line interface.

Step 2: I will used "cebase" command to change the parameter "start" to "base". This can be done by positioning the cursor on the "start" parameter and typing "cebase". The screen will then show "--INSERT--" as shown in the screenshot below.

Step 3: If we want to To exit input mode, I will use the "esc" key on my labtop. I can also repeat this process and change all the "start" parameter.

Step 4: After I changed all three parameters have been changed to "base", in this step is to save the changes to the file.
To save the changes made to the file, I will use the command ":wq<enter>". This will save the file and exit the file editor. 
Once the file is saved, the first part of the task is complete.


Part 2: 
In this is the second part of my ab report I would provide a summary of the data collected during the completion of the task. 
The first method was completed in 2 minutes and 46 seconds, while the second method was completed in 1 minute and 18 seconds. 
The data collected during the completion of the task showed that the second method was faster and more efficient. I would prefer the second one which was completed in 1 minute and 18 seconds.
